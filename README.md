# GeoHeat
Fast calculations for approximating geothermal energy by using hydraulic fracturing

Geothermal energy is an energy source that has the potential to supply plentiful, renewable energy. However, current implementations struggle to compete with other renewable energy methods because of the high startup costs. An alternative method using hydraulic fracturing can be used to vastly increase the amount of heat that can be extracted from rock (1). A mathematical model for this system was supplied by Gringarten as early as 1975 (2). In this repository, a simpler model is used to simulate and explore the same system using the same parameter values as Gringarten.
